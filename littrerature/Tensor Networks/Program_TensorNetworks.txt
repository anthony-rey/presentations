Week 1
Suggested outline
0. What is a tensor network, a MPS? Stress pictorial representation (10 )
1. exact representation of AKLT (VBS) (15)
2. what is SVD and its use (include all the proofs) (30)
3. Entanglement entropy + Schmidt decomposition + density matrix formalism (25)
4. Area law of entanglement (15)
5. Using MPS , compute the correlation length  (example in AKLT) (20)

Suggested reading
Orus paper: Section 1 to 5.1, and 6.1
Schollwoeck paper:  section 3 and 4 except 4.4


Week 2: "MRG" algorithms for ground states
0. MPO (section 5 of Schollwoeck)
1. Right and Left canonical state (section 4.4 Schollwoeck)
2. DMRG with MPS formalism (section 6.1, 6.2 & 6.3 of Schollwoeck)
